# Comp-Arquitecture
Group composed of 
Juan Pablo Ospina Bustamante and
John Sebastián Luján Figueroa

All the components that make a processor can be found here. They're implemented in VHDL. 
The Processor is a simple one, for now, it accepts sum and subtraction operations (without carry in the meanwhile), and logical 
operations, such as and, or, andn, orn, xor, xnor. A second window, and therefore any other component needed for window handling, 
is now implemented. Now looking into adding branch functions as well as a Data Memory (currently under DM Branch)
